# Cloudflare Tunnel Configuration Example
# This is optional - only needed if you want to expose a local FastAPI endpoint
# The core design uses Supabase job queue, so this is not required

tunnel: your-tunnel-id
credentials-file: /path/to/credentials.json

ingress:
  # Route to local FastAPI endpoint (if you add one)
  - hostname: worker-api.yourdomain.com
    service: http://localhost:8000
  # Catch-all rule
  - service: http_status:404
